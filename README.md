# Tic Tac Toe Game

[Project Site](https://diehardtictactoe.firebaseapp.com/)

## Overview

This version of Tic Tac Toe was produced as my first project for General Assembly's [Web Development Immersive program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive). It was built using AngularJS and Firebase.

It functions like any other game of Tic Tac Toe, but using AngularJS and Firebase, it allows two players to play a game with the same view from two different computers.

## How It Was Made

This project utilizes [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to dynamically synchronize the views of multiple users. This is made possible by [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), an API that enables realtime data updating for all application users.

## How To Use

The game can be played [here](https://nickmro-tic-tac-toe.firebaseapp.com/).

Click "Start Game" to play a match.
